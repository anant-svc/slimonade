#### History of this application
For many months I (individually) was searching for different packages/libraries in JavaScript and PHP langauges. I found many but they were limited to some extent when extending the functionality, code quality and support.

I finalize the PHP packages i.e. Slim Framework because of easily integrate any library and full control on routing. It is very easy and faster. I have build routing logic so that it works with templating library - [ Plates is maintained by RJ Garcia ]( https://platesphp.com/ )

To some time, I eventually subscribed to some quality newsletters for JavaScript and PHP. They showd the JavaScript library - LemonadeJS by Jspreadsheet.

I am guy who dosn't like to add more and more packages. Less is Good.

# FAQs

#### Why it is not open source?
In the age of AI and companies forking source codes of hard working developers and rename to their brand. I belive publishing code openly might cause license issues and others hard work. I have combine these wonderful tools in such a way that they work with each other. Slim work with templating engine. In Templating engine, I added useful functions and there are no match on Google. Even the Slim framework boilerplates do not have these things.

### Who will get the code?
I will share the code with you and teams. I will help to understand and customize ($). You can contact me here - https://form.jotform.com/241625475962464

### Where is code maintenaned?
