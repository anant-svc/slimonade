#### History of this application
For many months I (individually) was searching for different packages/libraries in JavaScript and PHP langauges. I found many but they were limited to some extent when extending the functionality, code quality and support.

I finalize the PHP packages i.e. Slim Framework because of extensive routing i.e. you can give any unicode word too. It is very easy and faster. I have build routing logic so that it works with templating library - [ Plates is maintained by RJ Garcia ]( https://platesphp.com/ )

To some time, I eventually subscribed to some quality newsletters for JavaScript and PHP. They showd the JavaScript library - LemonadeJS by Jspreadsheet.

I am guy who dosn't like to add more and more packages. Less is Good.

#### Why it is not open source?
In the age of AI and companies forking source code harding working developers. I belive publishing code openly might cause some issues with mine and others hard work. I have combine some tools in such a way that they work for each other.

### Who will get the code?
I will share the code with you and teams. I will help to understand too ($). You can post a message in discussion - https://github.com/anant-svc/slimonade/discussions/1
